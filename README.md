## Why?

This project is part of a quest provided by [Quine.sh](https://quine.sh/). The quest is to build a project using the [ChatGPT](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-the-vercel-ai-sdk) and [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/). I decided to build a weather app which can utilize these tools to enhance boring weather data provided by other weather apps.
